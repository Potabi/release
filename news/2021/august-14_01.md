## Potabi Development Pause for Rebase Question
##### August 14, 2021

Potabi is considering a rebase, no new developments will happen until whether or not a rebase is decided.

Want to help elect our rebase solution? Please participate in the [poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PotabiSystems/status/1426563834412634114).

**Why Rebase?** \
We are looking to rebase while we are dealing with major issues. Potabi has many goals that each of the three given solutions for a rebase are better and worse at. The solutions are:
- `FreeBSD` \
  Staying with FreeBSD gives us the ability to have better support overall for software. Especially since it comes with a larger software repository, and if we chose another base (Like DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD (unlisted option), NetBSD (unlisted option), etc), we still intend on bringing FreeBSD's ports and package manager. This will be difficult, but worth it for the project.
- `HardenedBSD` \
  Essentially FreeBSD with much higher security. The main reason we don't select it is some workflows on FreeBSD might be affected, speed might be affected, or something else users will be frustrated over. We just want to make sure that these community members are heard if they do, or do not, want a HardenedBSD base.
- `DragonflyBSD` \
  DragonflyBSD is added because of the fact that we know it exists, and that people like it. It also is a little different from FreeBSD, and has more control over their src, and aren't 100% a pure FreeBSD derivative.

Development is paused for the weekend, I will be starting senior year on Tuesday the 17th. Things will be slow for a while.
