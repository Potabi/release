# Potabi Release Engineering
Welcome to the Potabi release engineering website. Here you will find documentation for release, relese engineering, and more.

### Building a Release
There are multiple stages of building each and every Potabi release. Releases do not always match the FreeBSD upstream.

Step 1. Getting a base
Getting a base is very important to building a Potabi release. There are two options. Either, use the release engineering systems already in the [Release Engineering Repository](https://github.com/Potabi/release), or alternatively building a custom release engineering base with [Potabi SRC Directory](https://github.com/Potabi/potabi-src).
